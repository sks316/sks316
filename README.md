# Hi. I kinda exist sorta maybe.
I do things sometimes. Very, very stupid things. I don't think many people care though.

### A few pointless details about me

My chosen name is Ciel. My pronouns are she/her and I am a transgender woman.

### Here are a few of the stupid things I've done

* [Mewtwo bot, a very stupid and very random Discord bot that I never update because I lost interest](https://github.com/sks316/mewtwo-bot)
* [A few random UserCSS themes for random sites because the web just needs to be a bit more dark](https://github.com/sks316/usercss)
* [A few Discord Rich Presences for PreMiD, because why wouldn't you want to show your browser history to everyone on your Discord friend list?](https://premid.app/users/226098403304538122)
* [JSRLoader, because JetSetRadioLive is horribly insecure and it's incredible they haven't been sued yet and also free music, that too](https://github.com/sks316/JSRLoader)
* [Dark theme for RiiConnect24's website,](https://rc24.xyz) [which Larsen ended up reusing for MarioCube](https://mariocube.xyz)
* [A very bad website that I really should rewrite sometime because really everyone needs a website at some point](https://sks316.github.io)
