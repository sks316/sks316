# 👋 Hi. I'm a Lillie.
I do things sometimes.

Oh, and I want to be a [VTuber](https://www.howtogeek.com/720841/what-is-a-vtuber/). There's that too.

### 🙋‍♀️ A few things about me

My chosen name is Lillie. My pronouns are she/her and I am a transgender woman. My favorite game is Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness for the Nintendo GameCube. I am an age regressor

### 📔 Here are a few of the things I've worked on

* [Mewtwo bot, a Discord bot](https://mewtwo-bot.carrd.co)
* [A few Discord Rich Presence scripts for PreMiD](https://premid.app/users/226098403304538122)
* [An installer for BCML on Steam Deck](https://github.com/sks316/bcml-steamdeck)
