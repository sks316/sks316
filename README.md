# üëã Hi. I kinda exist sorta maybe.
I do things sometimes. Very, very stupid things. I don't think many people care though.

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A few pointless details about me

My chosen name is Ciel. My pronouns are she/her and I am a transgender woman. My favorite game is Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness for the Nintendo GameCube (which I wish would eventually get rereleased but know deep down it'll never happen).

### üìî Here are a few of the stupid things I've done

* [Mewtwo bot, a very stupid and very random Discord bot that I never update because I have no ideas](https://github.com/sks316/mewtwo-bot)
* [A few random UserCSS themes for random sites because the web just needs to be a bit more dark](https://github.com/sks316/usercss)
* [A few Discord Rich Presences for PreMiD, because why wouldn't you want to show your browser history to everyone on your Discord friend list](https://premid.app/users/226098403304538122)
* [JSRLoader, because JetSetRadioLive is horribly insecure and it's incredible they haven't been sued yet and also free music, that too](https://github.com/sks316/JSRLoader)
* [Dark theme for RiiConnect24's website,](https://rc24.xyz) [which Larsen ended up reusing for MarioCube](https://mariocube.xyz)
* [A very bad website that I really should rewrite sometime because really everyone needs a website at some point](https://sks316.github.io)

### üì´ Here's how you can reach me because idk maybe you wanna share a meme or something

* GitHub: well you're already on it so that's that
* Twitter: [@sks316_ because @sks316 was taken](https://twitter.com/sks316_)
* Telegram: [@sks316](https://telegram.dog/sks316)
* Discord: sks316#2523 or [on my epic gamer Discord server](https://discord.gg/2VYTgFB)
* Mastodon: [@sks316@mstdn.io](https://mstdn.io/@sks316)

Ever heard of being everywhere at once? Yeah, that's me in a nutshell.

### üí∏ I'm not sure why you'd like my stupid things enough to give me money

but if you want to, you're out of luck. I don't take monetary donations, as I am not legally allowed to own a PayPal account yet. I will, however, accept: video games, gift cards (Steam, Google Play, Nintendo eShop, prepaid Visa/MasterCard, etc.), Discord Nitro gifts, and hugs as valid forms of payment. Should you want to empty your bank account for me for some sadistic reason, you can contact me via one of the above methods.
